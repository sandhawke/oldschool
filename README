   The basic idea is that everything you type gets posted to your site
   (think microblog).  Meanwhile, anything posted by any of your contacts
   gets displayed, if it passes your current filters.

   time ago, back in school (rpi.edu).  Of course, they used different
   protocols, with somewhat different properties.
